# Gif finder

This is a simple gif finder, you can search in the navigation bar whatever you want and if it exists it will gives you depending on the topic a lot or few gifs.


## Appendix

Because it just a simple navigation application, you only can see gifs, you can't select or do nothing with these gifs, it was only a practice where I used my knowledge to create a navbar.

You can use the website if you click on this link: https://santiago0451.github.io/gif-finder-2.
